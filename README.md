# Starbucks-Capstone-Project

This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

# Motivation

This project to complete udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree capstone project 
I've chosen Starbucks data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, 
and build a model to predict the preferred offer by the clients

# Summary 

1) the highest of all models here was SVC by (0.89) for discount offer training

2) the lowest of all models here was KNeighborsClassifier Model by (0.60) for bogo training 

3) the company should focus to give more interesting offers to males since their income is higher

4) Discount and BOGO increase the customer buy rating
